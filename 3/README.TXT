...oooOOO Backstory OOOooo...

    Your little brother is downloading and installing, any
and everything he can find on the popular file-sharing networks.
Consequently he is always needing you to "fix" this computer.
His machine is a cesspool of malware. This one particular one
made no attempts at being covert. It appears to be some kind
of windows privilege escalator. To escalate however it injects
code into other processes. Now if only you knew which process
it wanted to inject into.....


...oooOOO CTF Challenge OOOooo...
    Find out which process this malware wants to inject into,
and trick it into triggering.
