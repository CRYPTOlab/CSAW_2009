aS'    This dll was found by a forensics team on a compromised computer.\nYou are fairly certain it is part of the attackers toolkit. The\nforensics team resports that the attacker attempted to "clean his\ntracks" by deleting a number of files from the filesystem. He forgot\nthis one however. The good thing is that all \'core functionality\' of\nthe attacker\'s toolkit seems to be in this dll. A guy from the forensics\ndepartment said he wrote a small executable (loader) to LoadLibraryA() the dll.\nHe says he suspects the dll just needs to be LoadLibraryA() by a process\nof the "correct" name.\n'

aS' \n    You were contacted by a worried system administrator.\nHe noticed about 2 weeks ago that someone had compromised\none of his domain controllers. He began monitoring suspicious\ntraffic going in and out of the machine. He noted that\nall the suspicious traffic was on TCP port 7777. When\nhe attempted to connect back to the attackers machine\nlate one night, he noticed a flurry of activity on the \ndomain controller and then the attacker was gone.\nAll that is left is a excerpt of traffic captures which \nhe has provided to you, and a single dll which you suspect\ncontains the encryption and decryption routines for \nthe network communication of the trojan.\n\nWhen viewing the suspicious dll in a tool like PEView\nor Depends.exe you notice that it exports 5 functions:\n    Tumbler1\n    Tumbler2\n    Tumbler3\n    Tumbler4 \n    and \n    Tumbler5\nYou suspect that (like a lock) these Tumblers must be strung together\nto properly encrypt and decrypt data.\n'

aS'    This particular piece of malware was found on a number of machines.\nIt is a banking trojan. It is designed to infect Internet Explorer\nand watch for when it is surfing to specific sites. This particular\ntrojan is implemented as a BHO (or Browser Helper Object). This means\nthat it is a single dll that is "registered" in a special way to associate\nitself with the Internet Explorer executable. Once running, internet explorer\nallows BHOs to "hook" (watch for) many different events: when documents start loading; finish\nloading; when keys are pressed; when mouse buttons are clicked; etc.\nA colleague of yours has provided you with a copy of the dll and batch files to load it with.
