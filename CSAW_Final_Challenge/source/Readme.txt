BUILDING:
----------
Building this driver was just a matter of setting the build environment
using the winddk tool "set env" with the proper options, then running nmake.

LOADING/USING:
--------------
The driver is then started/registered from SYSTEM cmd.exe using load_driver.bat
(which uses the service manager).

OTHER STUFF:
------------
The hints and the solution were all generated by compiling slightly differing version of
ktrace_ctl.exe to different names (changing the source in between compiles to
use different IOCTLS).
