...oooOOO Backstory OOOooo...
This binary was downloaded originally as "codec.exe" from a site
claiming to distribute free full length movies
on the internet (as long as you install their "driver" ;-)
Although this particular binary was not actually installed anywhere
on your company network, you (rightfully) suspect that this is a
piece of malware. When you execute it however, it crashes (like
other malware you have seen in the past). What is unique about
this one however is that it seems to have a few antidebugging
techniques, one you have seen before and a newer one that somehow
involves timing.

...oooOOO CTF Task OOOooo...
Get 6.exe to execute to the point that it will display
the flag to you, or if you want you can reverse the
flag out directly, but that is the hard way.
