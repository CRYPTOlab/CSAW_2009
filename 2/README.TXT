...oooOOO Backstory OOOooo...
    This binary was found on one of your client's sensitive
internal systems. It was originally part of the attacker's
bundle of tools however, due to the clumsiness of one of your
co-workers one of the accompanying executables was lost.
Now all you have is 2.exe. You suspect that the lost executable
was actually the launcher for this one, it probably performed
runtime patching on this binary so that it would run.
Figure out what you need to do to get 2.exe to run.

...oooOOO CTF Task OOOooo...
Get 2.exe to execute to the point that it will display
the flag to you, or if you want you can reverse the
flag out directly, but that is the hard way.
