...oooOOO Backstory OOOooo...

The executable 1.exe was found on one of your client's compromised systems. 
This is a suspected piece of malware. You have been tasked with finding out 
what the malware does. It appears the malware writer made a mistake and the 
process is prematurely exiting.


...oooOOO CTF Task OOOooo...
Get the process to the point where it will display the flag to you,
or simply reverse the flag out of the executable.
